# Employee Performance Analysis with Pandas Task

<img src="./assets/data-pandas.webp" alt="Pandas Logo" width="300">

**Welcome to the Data Department!** I'm excited to have you join our team. Given your strong performance in your previous role, I'm confident you'll excel here as well. To help you get up to speed with our data analysis tools and processes, I'm assigning you a project that will introduce you to Pandas, a crucial library for data manipulation in Python.

## Project Objective

Your task is to analyze our company's employee performance dataset using Pandas. This project will help you familiarize yourself with essential data analysis techniques while providing valuable insights for our HR department.

## Environment Setup

If you need a reference for setting up your workspace and virtual environment please refer to the [Python Workspace Setup](https://github.com/jdrichards-pursuit/python-virtual-environment-setup)

## Data:

Before you begin to analyze the data, take a look at the [employee_performance.csv](./data/employee_performance.csv) as well as the [data-dictionary.md](./data/data-dictionary.md) to understand our company's employee performance data.

## Code Guidelines

1. Implement your solution in the `employee_performance_challenge.py` file.

2. Write your functions above the `main` function. The following functions need to be implemented:

   - `load_employee_data()`
   - `explore_employee_dataframe(df)`
   - `select_and_filter_employee_data(df)`
   - `employee_data_operations(df)`
   - `top_3_employees_with_highest_salary(df)`
   - `avg_performance_score_by_department(df)`
   - `plot_salary_vs_years_of_experience(df)`

3. The `main` function is already provided and contains calls to your functions.

4. To test your implementation:

   - Uncomment the print statements in the `main` function.
   - Run the script in the terminal to see the output using `python3 employee_performance_challenge.py`.

5. Do not modify the `main` function itself; only implement the required functions above it.

## Note

Ensure your functions match the expected names and signatures as they are already being called in the `main` function.

## Dataset:

The employee performance dataset is stored in a CSV file named [`employee_performance.csv`](./data/employee_performance.csv) in the `data` directory.

**Note:** If you can't remember how to complete any of the steps, check out the [Pandas Basics Tutorial](https://github.com/jdrichards-pursuit/week-5.1-python-theory) for a refresher. Try not to use AI for this, use the lesson, documentation for [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/) or do the research online. If you do use AI, create prompts that check for understanding and avoid simply giving you the answer.

## Steps:

### 1. Load the Data:

Write a function `load_employee_data()` to load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.

### 1.1. Convert all column names to lowercase

Use the `df.columns = df.columns.str.lower()` to convert all column names to lowercase.

This will make it easier to work with the data in the rest of the challenge.

### 2. Explore the DataFrame:

Write a function `explore_employee_dataframe(df)` to:

- Display the first 10 rows.
- Show the DataFrame info.
- Provide summary statistics.

### 3. Select and Filter Data:

Write a function `select_and_filter_employee_data(df)` to:

- Select the 'employee_id', 'first_name', 'last_name', and 'performance_score' columns.
- Filter employees with a `performance_score` greater than 80.
- Use `loc` to select specific rows and columns.

### 4. Perform Data Operations:

Write a function `employee_data_operations(df)` to:

- Add a new column `salary_per_year` that displays the salary based on the number of years the employee has worked at the company.
- Sort the DataFrame by `performance_score` in descending order.

### 5. Find the top 3 employees with the highest salary

Write a function `top_3_employees_with_highest_salary(df)` to:

- Sort the DataFrame by `salary` in descending order.
- Select the top 3 employees.
- Display their `first_name`, `last_name` and `email`, and `salary. Salary should be rounded to 2 decimal places.

### 6. Calculate the average performance score by department

Write a function `avg_performance_score_by_department(df)` to calculate the average performance score by department.

- Display the average performance score for each department.

### 7. Plot a scatter plot of salary vs years_at_company

Write a function `plot_salary_vs_years_of_experience(df)` to plot a scatter plot of salary vs years_at_company.

- use plt.scatter to plot the data
- use plt.show to display the plot
